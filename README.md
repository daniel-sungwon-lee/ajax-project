## **What I Learned From Working on This Project:**
* The importance of planning everything out before coding; you can't have execution without the idea and vice versa. Surprisingly, coming up with each feature and how I was going to execute them through code took a while to think and plan out, since I also had to make sure my APIs would fetch the correct data I wanted. 
* The importance of having a clean, organized, and readable code; the foundation is very important. I realized that it is better to take the extra time to think about how I am going to organize and write my code in a logical and organized manner so that I can make my application scalable for additional features later on down the road. If I can't quickly access the different parts of my code and if don't know what parts of a code is for what feature, then it may get very frustrating to debug and even add additional features later on; it is better to add and build on top of the current code I have. 
* The importance of organizing data. Since I was working with different APIs and getting different types of data, I realized it is important to know how to organize and store those different types of data in a way I could not only fetch them easily from a database but also build upon that data model I initially created to add additional types of data to the exisiting data model if I choose to add additional features that require different data types later on. 
* The importance of the user experience and interface; I tend to like a simple, straightforward layout and interface for users so they don't get lost in my application and have a bad time using it. It is important that the app is able to be used by anyone with no extra instructions needed on how to use the application, with a clean layout and aesthetic.
* The importance of responsiveness. Since there are multiple ways a user can access the web app, it is important to make the application responsive to different types of devices.
